    "In this problem set we will model the chances of high school students being accepted into two different elite undergraduate colleges (one is elite at least :) ): Harvard and Yale.  The data are provided in the file `data/college_admissions.csv` and were scraped from [collegedata.com](https://www.collegedata.com/) (where applicants volunteer to share their information).  Each observation corresponds to an applicant to one of the two different colleges (note: the same applicant may show up in two rows: once for each college).  The main response is the `\"admitted\"` variable (1 = admitted, 0 = denied), and there are are several predictors to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **id**: a unique identifier for the applicant \n",
    "- **test_score**: a standardized measurement of the applicant's highest ACT or SAT combined score (2400 is the maximum)\n",
    "- **ap**: the number of AP tests taken\n",
    "- **avg_ap**: the average score on the AP tests taken (0 if no tests were taken)\n",
    "- **sat_subjects**: the number of SAT subject tests taken\n",
    "- **gpa**: the unweighted GPA of the applicant (max of 4.0)\n",
    "- **female**:  a binary indicator for gender: 1 = female, 0 = otherwise\n",
    "- **minority**: a binary indicator for under-represented minority: 1 = minority, 0 = otherwise \n",
    "- **international**: a binary indicator for international status: 1 = international, 0 = United States\n",
    "- **sports**: a binary indicator for High School All-American: 1 = all-American athlete, 0 = otherwise\n",
    "- **school**: a categorical variable for school applied to: \"Harvard\" or \"Yale\"\n",
    "- **early_app**: a binary indicator for application type: 1 = early action, 0 = regular\n",
    "- **alumni**:  a binary indicator for parents' alumni status of school: 1 = a parent is an alumnus, 0 = otherwise\n",
    "- **program**: the program applied to by the student with many choices (we will not use this as a predictor)\n",
    "- **add_info**: additional (optional) info provided by applicant (we will not use this as a predictor)\n",

    "**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unless stated otherwise, all logistic regression models should be unregularized (use `penalty=\"none\"`) and include the intercept (which is the default in `sklearn`).\n",
    "\n",

    "- When printing your output (e.g. coefficients, accuracy scores, etc.), DO NOT just print numbers without context. Please be certain provide clarifying labels for all printed numbers and limit the number of digits showing after decimals to a reasonable length (e.g. 4 decimal points for coefficients and accuracy scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "**Q4.1** You were instructed to NOT scale predictors in the prior sections above. The primary reason for this was to focus instead on the interpretability of our logistic regression coefficients. However, as we're sure you noticed, the numeric scale among our different predictors varies greatly (i.e. `test_score` values are in the 1,000's while others are much, much smaller). In practice, we might want to put our predictors all on a similar scale, particularly for regularized regression and/or distance-based algorithms such as $k$-NN classification. **(1)** Please explain why scaling under these circumstances might be important. Then, **(2)** actually apply standardized scaling to all of the **non-binary** predictors in our original set of 12 predictors. **For the sake of consistency, fit your scaler on just the training data. Then use it to transform both train and test.**\n",

Use `ks = [1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 21, 51, 71, 101, 131, 171, 201]` and 10-fold cross-validation with classification accuracy as the scoring metric. Plot, on a single set of axes, your resulting cross-validation mean training and mean validation scores at each value $k$. Then, store your chosen $k$ in `best_k` and the classification accuracy on train and test for your final fitted model as `knn_train_acc` and `knn_test_acc`.\n",
